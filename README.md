# spring-docker-github-cicd

This repository contains a Spring Boot application with Docker support and CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhardwaj2000/spring-docker-github-cicd.git
cd spring-docker-github-cicd
```

### 2. Pull the Docker Image

The application is available as a Docker image. You can pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull manish172000/spring-docker-github-cicd:latest
```

> **Note:** If the image is not published, you can build it locally (see below).

### 3. Run the Application with Docker

Start the container (update the image name as needed):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 manish172000/spring-docker-github-cicd:latest
```

This will run the app in detached mode and map port 8080 of your host to the container.

#### Build and Run Locally (if needed)

If you want to build the Docker image from source:

```sh
docker build -t spring-docker-github-cicd .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 spring-docker-github-cicd
```
